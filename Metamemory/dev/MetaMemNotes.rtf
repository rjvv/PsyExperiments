Participants were told that they would be asked 20 trivia questions and that the time it took to answer each question was of primary interest to the experimenters. Thus, it was explained, they were to press the Enter key as soon as they knew the answer to the presented question. No explicit instructions concerning guessing were given.\
It was emphasized to participants that they should not press the Enter key before mentally generating an answer but that they should do so as soon as possible after coming up with an answer. Participants were told that the question would then disappear from the screen and that they were to enter their answer, a space, and then their prediction of free recall for that word. This prediction was denned as the subjective percentage probability that they would be able to produce that answer again in 20 min on a blank sheet of paper with no cues. It was explained that because their predictions were to represent probabilities, the values of those predictions should range from 0 (meaning no chance of later recall) to 100 (meaning certain later recall). They were told that no prediction was to be made if they had not come up with an answer. Participants were further instructed that the nature of the final recall task was such that the questions would not be re-presented and were shown a blank sheet of paper to emphasize the conditions under which that task would be performed.\
